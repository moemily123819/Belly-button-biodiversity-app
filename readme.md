### **About the data :**

It is based on the coolest study of biodiversity on the human body on the planet.  Weblink : http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/.

The belly button is one of the habitats closest to us, and yet it remains relatively unexplored. In January 2011, investigation of the microbes inhabiting our navels was conducted.  This project inspired conversations about the beneficial roles microbes play in our daily lives.

The most common skin bacteria encountered on participants in the Belly Button Biodiversity Project belonged to the groups Staphylococci, Corynebacteria, Actinobacteria, Clostridiales, and Bacilli.

 

### **About this dashboard :**

This app uses :

- HTML/CSS/Bootstrap, 
- flask app (python), 
- javascript, 
- plot-ly, 
- ajax,
- sqlite, 
- sql-alchemy 
- and json format.  

The flask app renders the template which uses javascript to drive the selection of the belly button samples for data visualization.
